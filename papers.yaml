  abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach for building cellular automata
    to solve real-world segmentation problems. We design and train a cellular automaton
    that can successfully segment high-resolution images. We consider a colony that
    densely inhabits the pixel grid, and all cells are governed by a randomized update
    that uses the current state, the color, and the state of the 3×3 neighborhood.
    The space of possible rules is deﬁned by a small neural network. The update rule
    is applied repeatedly in parallel to a large random subset of cells and after
    convergence is used to produce segmentation masks that are then back-propagated
    to learn the optimal update rules using standard gradient descent methods. We
    demonstrate that such models can be learned eﬃciently with only limited trajectory
    length and that they show remarkable ability to organize the information to produce
    a globally consistent segmentation result, using only local information exchange.

  abstract: This paper presents a novel framework using neural cellular automata (NCA)
    to regenerate and predict geographic information. The model extends the idea of
    using NCA to generate/regenerate a speciﬁc image by training the model with various
    geographic data, and thus, taking the trafﬁc condition map as an example, the
    model is able to predict trafﬁc conditions by giving certain induction information.
    Our research veriﬁed the analogy between NCA and gene in biology, while the innovation
    of the model signiﬁcantly widens the boundary of possible applications based on
    NCAs. From our experimental results, the model shows great potentials in its usability
    and versatility which are not available in previous studies. The code for model
    implementation is available at https://redacted.

  abstract: In this work, we present a probabilistic 3D generative model, named Generative
    Cellular Automata, which is able to produce diverse and high quality shapes. We
    formulate the shape generation process as sampling from the transition kernel
    of a Markov chain, where the sampling chain eventually evolves to the full shape
    of the learned distribution. The transition kernel employs the local update rules
    of cellular automata, effectively reducing the search space in a high-resolution
    3D grid space by exploiting the connectivity and sparsity of 3D shapes. Our progressive
    generation only focuses on the sparse set of occupied voxels and their neighborhood,
    thus enables the utilization of an expressive sparse convolutional network. We
    propose an effective training scheme to obtain the local homogeneous rule of generative
    cellular automata with sequences that are slightly different from the sampling
    chain but converge to the full shapes in the training data. Extensive experiments
    on probabilistic shape completion and shape generation demonstrate that our method
    achieves competitive performance against recent methods.

    artworks) by using neural cellular automatas (NCAs). Rather than training NCAs
    based on single images one by one, we combined the idea with variational autoencoders

    fusion. The code for model implementation is available online.

  abstract: 'Morphological regeneration is an important feature that highlights the
    environmental adaptive capacity of biological systems. Lack of this regenerative
    capacity signiﬁcantly limits the resilience of machines and the environments they
    can operate in. To aid in addressing this gap, we develop an approach for simulated
    soft robots to regrow parts of their morphology when being damaged. Although numerical
    simulations using soft robots have played an important role in their design, evolving
    soft robots with regenerative capabilities have so far received comparable little
    attention. Here we propose a model for soft robots that regenerate through a neural
    cellular automata. Importantly, this approach only relies on local cell information
    to regrow damaged components, opening interesting possibilities for physical regenerable
    soft robots in the future. Our approach allows simulated soft robots that are
    damaged to partially regenerate their original morphology through local cell interactions
    alone and regain some of their ability to locomote. These results take a step
    towards equipping artiﬁcial systems with regenerative capacities and could potentially
    allow for more robust operations in a variety of situations and environments.

  abstract: 'Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) have been proven effective in simulating
    morphogenetic processes, the continuous construction of complex structures from
    very few starting cells. Recent developments in NCAs lie in the 2D domain, namely
    reconstructing target images from a single pixel or inﬁnitely growing 2D textures.
    In this work, we propose an extension of NCAs to 3D, utilizing 3D convolutions
    in the proposed neural network architecture. Minecraft is selected as the environment
    for our automaton since it allows the generation of both static structures and
    moving machines. We show that despite their simplicity, NCAs are capable of growing
    complex entities such as castles, apartment blocks, and trees, some of which are
    composed of over 3,000 blocks. Additionally, when trained for regeneration, the
    system is able to regrow parts of simple functional machines, signiﬁcantly expanding
    the capabilities of simulated morphogenetic systems. The code for the experiment

  abstract: Neural CAs define local interactions which together grow into a global design. 
    Instead of one system for one design, we can define a general system which grows many designs. 
    This lets us condition our neural CA by giving it different design-specific "seeds". StampCA models 
    encode design-specific information in the cell state, and generic information in the network parameters. 
    This means we can 1. grow many designs without retraining, and 2. grow all these designs in the same world.

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have shown a remarkable ability to learn
    the required rules to "grow" images, classify morphologies, segment images, as
    well as to do general computation such as path-finding. We believe the inductive
    prior they introduce lends itself to the generation of textures. Textures in the
    natural world are often generated by variants of locally interacting reaction-diffusion
    systems. Human-made textures are likewise often generated in a local manner (textile
    weaving, for instance) or using rules with local dependencies (regular grids or
    geometric patterns). We demonstrate learning a texture generator from a single
    template image, with the generation method being embarrassingly parallel, exhibiting
    quick convergence and high fidelity of output, and requiring only some minimal
    assumptions around the underlying state manifold. Furthermore, we investigate
    properties of the learned models that are both useful and interesting, such as
    non-stationary dynamics and an inherent robustness to damage. Finally, we make
    qualitative claims that the behaviour exhibited by the NCA model is a learned,
    distributed, local algorithm to generate a texture, setting our method apart from
    existing work on texture generation. We discuss the advantages of such a paradigm.

  abstract: Very recently, the Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) has been proposed to
    simulate the morphogenesis process with deep networks. NCA learns to grow an image
    starting from a fixed single pixel. In this work, we show that the neural network
    (NN) architecture of the NCA can be encapsulated in a larger NN. This allows us
    to propose a new model that encodes a manifold of NCA, each of them capable of
    generating a distinct image. Therefore, we are effectively learning an embedding
    space of CA, which shows generalization capabilities. We accomplish this by introducing
    dynamic convolutions inside an Auto-Encoder architecture, for the first time used
    to join two different sources of information, the encoding and cell’s environment
    information. In biological terms, our approach would play the role of the transcription
    factors, modulating the mapping of genes into specific proteins that drive cellular
    differentiation, which occurs right before the morphogenesis. We thoroughly evaluate
    our approach in a dataset of synthetic emojis and also in real images of CIFAR-10.
    Our model introduces a general-purpose network, which can be used in a broad range
    of problems beyond image generation.

    boil down to trial-and-error parameter search. We propose a differentiable optimization
    method for learning the RD system parameters to perform example-based texture
    synthesis on a 2D plane. We do this by representing the RD system as a variant
    of Neural Cellular Automata and using task-speciﬁc differentiable loss functions.
    RD systems generated by our method exhibit robust, non-trivial “life-like” behavior.

  abstract: Neural cellular automata (Neural CA) are a recent framework used to model
    biological phenomena emerging from multicellular organisms. In these systems,
    artiﬁcial neural networks are used as update rules for cellular automata. Neural
    CA are end-to-end differentiable systems where the parameters of the neural network
    can be learned to achieve a particular task. In this work, we used neural CA to
    control a cart-pole agent. The observations of the environment are transmitted
    in input cells while the values of output cells are used as a readout of the system.
    We trained the model using deep-Q learning where the states of the output cells
    were used as the q-value estimates to be optimized. We found that the computing
    abilities of the cellular automata were maintained over several hundreds of thousands
    of iterations, producing an emergent stable behavior in the environment it controls
    for thousands of steps. Moreover, the system demonstrated life-like phenomena
    such as a developmental phase, regeneration after damage, stability despite a
    noisy environment, and robustness to unseen disruption such as input deletion.

  abstract: Abstract. Cellular Automata have intrigued curious minds for the better
    part of the last century, with significant contributions to their field from the
    likes of Von Neumann et al. (1966), John Conway (Gardner (1970)), and Wolfram
    and Gad-el Hak (2003). They can simulate and model phenomena in biology, chemistry,
    and physics (Chopard and Droz (1998)). Recently, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)
    have demonstrated a capacity to learn complex behaviour, including constructing
    a target morphology (Mordvintsev et al. (2020)), classifying the shape they occupy
    (Randazzo et al. (2020)), or segmentation of images (Sandler et al. (2020)). As
    a computational model, NCA have appealing properties. They are parallelisable,
    fault tolerant and partially robust to operating on manifolds other than those
    used during training. A strong parallel exists between training NCA and system
    identification of a partial differential equation (PDE) satisfying certain boundary
    value conditions. In the original work by Mordvintsev et al. (2020), asynchronicity
    in cell updates is justified by a desire to have purely local communication between
    cells. We demonstrate that asynchronicity is not just an ideological feature of
    the model and is in fact necessary to learn a well-behaved PDE and to allow the
    model to be used in arbitrary integrators.

  abstract: Motivated by the interaction between cells, the recently introduced concept
    of Neural Cellular Automata shows promising results in a variety of tasks. So
    far, this concept was mostly used to generate images for a single scenario. As
    each scenario requires a new model, this type of generation seems contradictory
    to the adaptability of cells in nature. To address this contradiction, we introduce
    a concept using different initial environments as input while using a single Neural
    Cellular Automata to produce several outputs. Additionally, we introduce GANCA,
    a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with Generative Adversarial
    Networks, allowing for more generalization through adversarial training. The experiments
    show that a single model is capable of learning several images when presented
    with different inputs, and that the adversarially trained model improves drastically
    on out-of-distribution data compared to a supervised trained model.

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have been trained to produce target images
    and shapes and even to regenerate after damage. These are highly attractive properties
    that can inform work on collective robotic construction. We discuss concepts from
    NCA that may be useful for collective robotic construction and discuss how the
    problems of morphogenesis and construction differ. As a concrete first step, we
    propose a simplified variant of an existing NCA model to explore the consequences
    of reducing the number of state channels encoded. We find that the NCA can still
    reproduce trained images. This bodes well for translating ideas from N CAs to
    collective robotic construction.

  abstract: We study the problem of example-based procedural texture synthesis using
    highly compact models. Given a sample image, we use differentiable programming
    to train a generative process, parameterised by a recurrent Neural Cellular Automata
    (NCA) rule. Contrary to the common belief that neural networks should be signiﬁcantly
    overparameterised, we demonstrate that our model architecture and training procedure
    allows for representing complex texture patterns using just a few hundred learned
    parameters, making their expressivity comparable to hand-engineered procedural
    texture generating programs. The smallest models from the proposed µNCA family
    scale down to 68 parameters. When using quantisation to one byte per parameter,
    proposed models can be shrunk to a size range between 588 and 68 bytes. Implementation
    of a texture generator that uses these parameters to produce images is possible

  abstract: 'We present a method of generating diverse collections of neural cellular
    automata (NCA) to design video game levels. While NCAs have so far only been trained
    via supervised learning, we present a quality diversity (QD) approach to generating
    a collection of NCA level generators. By framing the problem as a QD problem,
    our approach can train diverse level generators, whose output levels vary based
    on aesthetic or functional criteria. To efficiently generate NCAs, we train generators
    via Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAPElites (CMA-ME), a quality diversity algorithm
    which specializes in continuous search spaces. We apply our new method to generate
    level generators for several 2D tile-based games: a maze game, Sokoban, and Zelda.
    Our results show that CMA-ME can generate small NCAs that are diverse yet capable,
    often satisfying complex solvability criteria for deterministic agents. We compare
    against a Compositional Pattern-Producing Network (CPPN) baseline trained to produce
    diverse collections of generators and show that the NCA representation yields
    a better exploration of level-space.'

  abstract: In nature, the process of cellular growth and differentiation has lead
    to an amazing diversity of organisms — algae, starﬁsh, giant sequoia, tardigrades,
    and orcas are all created by the same generative process. Inspired by the incredible
    diversity of this biological generative process, we propose a generative model,
    the Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), which is loosely inspired by
    the biological processes of cellular growth and differentiation. Unlike previous
    related works, the VNCA is a proper probabilistic generative model, and we evaluate
    it according to best practices. We ﬁnd that the VNCA learns to reconstruct samples
    well and that despite its relatively few parameters and simple local-only communication,
    the VNCA can learn to generate a large variety of output from information encoded
    in a common vector format. While there is a signiﬁcant gap to the current state-of-the-art
    in terms of generative modeling performance, we show that the VNCA can learn a
    purely self-organizing generative process of data. Additionally, we show that
    the VNCA can learn a distribution of stable attractors that can recover from signiﬁcant
    damage.

    (NCAs) have been capable of ”growing” artiﬁcial cells into images, 3D structures,
    and even functional machines. NCAs are ﬂexible and robust computational systems
    but – similarly to many other self-organizing systems — inherently uncontrollable
    during and after their growth process. We present an approach to control these
    type of systems called Goal-Guided Neural Cellular Automata (GoalNCA), which leverages
    goal encodings to control cell behavior dynamically at every step of cellular
    growth. This approach enables the NCA to continually change behavior, and in some
    cases, generalize its behavior to unseen scenarios. We also demonstrate the robustness
    of the NCA with its ability to preserve task performance, even when only a portion
    of cells receive goal information.

  abstract: 'Modeling the ability of multicellular organisms to build and maintain
    their bodies through local interactions between individual cells (morphogenesis)
    is a long-standing challenge of developmental biology. Recently, the Neural Cellular
    Automata (NCA) model was proposed as a way to ﬁnd local system rules that produce
    a desired global behaviour, such as growing and persisting a predeﬁned pattern,
    by repeatedly applying the same rule over a grid starting from a single cell.
    In this work we argue that the original Growing NCA model has an important limitation:
    anisotropy of the learned update rule. This implies the presence of an external
    factor that orients the cells in a particular direction. In other words, “physical”
    rules of the underlying system are not invariant to rotation, thus prohibiting
    the existence of differently oriented instances of the target pattern on the same
    grid. We propose a modiﬁed Isotropic NCA model that does not have this limitation.
    We demonstrate that cell systems can be trained to grow accurate asymmetrical
    patterns through either of two methods: by breaking symmetries using structured
    seeds; or by introducing a rotation-reﬂection invariant training objective and
    relying on symmetry breaking caused by asynchronous cell updates.'

  abstract: 'Information-theoretic fitness functions are becoming increasingly popular
    to produce generally useful, task-independent behaviors. One such universal function,
    dubbed empowerment, measures the amount of control an agent exerts on its environment
    via its sensorimotor system. Specifically, empowerment attempts to maximize the
    mutual information between an agent''s actions and its received sensor states
    at a later point in time. Traditionally, empowerment has been applied to a conventional
    sensorimotor apparatus, such as a robot. Here, we expand the approach to a distributed,
    multi-agent sensorimotor system embodied by a neural cellular automaton (NCA).
    We show that the addition of empowerment as a secondary objective in the evolution
    of NCA to perform the task of morphogenesis, growing and maintaining a pre-specified
    shape, results in higher fitness compared to evolving for morphogenesis alone.
    Results suggest there may be a synergistic relationship between morphogenesis
    and empowerment. That is, indirectly selecting for coordination between neighboring
    cells over the duration of development is beneficial to the developmental process
    itself. Such a finding may have applications in developmental biology by providing
    potential mechanisms of communication between cells during growth from a single
    cell to a multicellular, target morphology. Source code for the experiments in
    this paper can be found at: https://github.com/caitlingrasso/empowered-nca.'

    to advance a wide range of engineering applications and industries. Biological
    systems possess the ability not only to self-reconfigure but also to self-classify
    themselves to determine a general shape and function. Previous work into modular
    robotics systems has only enabled self-recognition and self-reconfiguration into
    a specific target shape, missing the inherent robustness present in nature to
    self-classify. In this paper we therefore take advantage of recent advances in
    deep learning and neural cellular automata, and present a simple modular 2D robotic
    system that can infer its own class of shape through the local communication of
    its components. Furthermore, we show that our system can be successfully transferred
    to hardware which thus opens opportunities for future self-classifying machines.

    a new family of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) techniques. Inspired by Transformer-based
    architectures, our work presents a new class of $\textit{attention-based}$ NCAs
    formed using a spatially localized$\unicode{x2014}$yet globally organized$\unicode{x2014}$self-attention
    scheme. We introduce an instance of this class named $\textit{Vision Transformer
    Cellular Automata}$ (ViTCA). We present quantitative and qualitative results on
    denoising autoencoding across six benchmark datasets, comparing ViTCA to a U-Net,
    a U-Net-based CA baseline (UNetCA), and a Vision Transformer (ViT). When comparing
    across architectures configured to similar parameter complexity, ViTCA architectures
    yield superior performance across all benchmarks and for nearly every evaluation
    metric. We present an ablation study on various architectural configurations of
    ViTCA, an analysis of its effect on cell states, and an investigation on its inductive
    biases. Finally, we examine its learned representations via linear probes on its
    converged cell state hidden representations, yielding, on average, superior results
    when compared to our U-Net, ViT, and UNetCA baselines.

  abstract: Pathfinding makes up an important sub-component of a broad range of complex
    tasks in AI, such as robot path planning, transport routing, and game playing.
    While classical algorithms can efficiently compute shortest paths, neural networks
    could be better suited to adapting these sub-routines to more complex and intractable
    tasks. As a step toward developing such networks, we hand-code and learn models
    for Breadth-First Search (BFS), i.e. shortest path finding, using the unified
    architectural framework of Neural Cellular Automata, which are iterative neural
    networks with equal-size inputs and outputs. Similarly, we present a neural implementation
    of Depth-First Search (DFS), and outline how it can be combined with neural BFS
    to produce an NCA for computing diameter of a graph. We experiment with architectural
    modifications inspired by these hand-coded NCAs, training networks from scratch
    to solve the diameter problem on grid mazes while exhibiting strong generalization
    ability. Finally, we introduce a scheme in which data points are mutated adversarially
    during training. We find that adversarially evolving mazes leads to increased
    generalization on out-of-distribution examples, while at the same time generating
    data-sets with significantly more complex solutions for reasoning tasks.

  abstract: 'Cellular automata (CAs) are computational models exhibiting rich dynamics
    emerging from the local interaction of cells arranged in a regular lattice. Graph
    CAs (GCAs) generalise standard CAs by allowing for arbitrary graphs rather than
    regular lattices, similar to how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) generalise Convolutional
    NNs. Recently, Graph Neural CAs (GNCAs) have been proposed as models built on
    top of standard GNNs that can be trained to approximate the transition rule of
    any arbitrary GCA. Existing GNCAs are anisotropic in the sense that their transition
    rules are not equivariant to translation, rotation, and reflection of the nodes''
    spatial locations. However, it is desirable for instances related by such transformations
    to be treated identically by the model. By replacing standard graph convolutions
    with E(n)-equivariant ones, we avoid anisotropy by design and propose a class
    of isotropic automata that we call E(n)-GNCAs. These models are lightweight, but
    can nevertheless handle large graphs, capture complex dynamics and exhibit emergent
    self-organising behaviours. We showcase the broad and successful applicability
    of E(n)-GNCAs on three different tasks: (i) pattern formation, (ii) graph auto-encoding,
    and (iii) simulation of E(n)-equivariant dynamical systems.'

  abstract: Access to the proper infrastructure is critical when performing medical
    image segmentation with Deep Learning. This requirement makes it difficult to
    run state-of-the-art segmentation models in resource-constrained scenarios like
    primary care facilities in rural areas and during crises. The recently emerging
    field of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) has shown that locally interacting one-cell
    models can achieve competitive results in tasks such as image generation or segmentations
    in low-resolution inputs. However, they are constrained by high VRAM requirements
    and the difficulty of reaching convergence for high-resolution images. To counteract
    these limitations we propose Med-NCA, an end-to-end NCA training pipeline for
    high-resolution image segmentation. Our method follows a two-step process. Global
    knowledge is first communicated between cells across the downscaled image. Following
    that, patch-based segmentation is performed. Our proposed Med-NCA outperforms
    the classic UNet by 2% and 3% Dice for hippocampus and prostate segmentation,
    respectively, while also being 500 times smaller. We also show that Med-NCA is
    by design invariant with respect to image scale, shape and translation, experiencing
    only slight performance degradation even with strong shifts; and is robust against
    MRI acquisition artefacts. Med-NCA enables high-resolution medical image segmentation
    even on a Raspberry Pi B+, arguably the smallest device able to run PyTorch and
    that can be powered by a standard power bank.

  abstract: 'Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) models have shown remarkable capacity
    for pattern formation and complex global behaviors stemming from local coordination.
    However, in the original implementation of NCA, cells are incapable of adjusting
    their own orientation, and it is the responsibility of the model designer to orient
    them externally. A recent isotropic variant of NCA (Growing Isotropic Neural Cellular
    Automata) makes the model orientation-independent - cells can no longer tell up
    from down, nor left from right - by removing its dependency on perceiving the
    gradient of spatial states in its neighborhood. In this work, we revisit NCA with
    a different approach: we make each cell responsible for its own orientation by
    allowing it to "turn" as determined by an adjustable internal state. The resulting
    Steerable NCA contains cells of varying orientation embedded in the same pattern.
    We observe how, while Isotropic NCA are orientation-agnostic, Steerable NCA have
    chirality: they have a predetermined left-right symmetry. We therefore show that
    we can train Steerable NCA in similar but simpler ways than their Isotropic variant
    by: (1) breaking symmetries using only two seeds, or (2) introducing a rotation-invariant
    training objective and relying on asynchronous cell updates to break the up-down

  abstract: Current Dynamic Texture Synthesis (DyTS) models can synthesize realistic
    videos. However, they require a slow iterative optimization process to synthesize
    a single fixed-size short video, and they do not offer any post-training control
    over the synthesis process. We propose Dynamic Neural Cellular Automata (DyNCA),
    a framework for real-time and controllable dynamic texture synthesis. Our method
    is built upon the recently introduced NCA models and can synthesize infinitely
    long and arbitrary-sized realistic video textures in real time. We quantitatively
    and qualitatively evaluate our model and show that our synthesized videos appear
    more realistic than the existing results. We improve the SOTA DyTS performance
    by $2\sim 4$ orders of magnitude. Moreover, our model offers several real-time
    video controls including motion speed, motion direction, and an editing brush
    tool. We exhibit our trained models in an online interactive demo that runs on
    local hardware and is accessible on personal computers and smartphones.

  abstract: We propose Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) to simulate the microstructure
    development during the solidification process in metals. Based on convolutional
    neural networks, NCA can learn essential solidification features, such as preferred
    growth direction and competitive grain growth, and are up to six orders of magnitude
    faster than the conventional Cellular Automata (CA). Notably, NCA delivers reliable
    predictions also outside their training range, which indicates that they learn
    the physics of the solidification process. While in this study we employ data
    produced by CA for training, NCA can be trained based on any microstructural simulation
    data, e.g. from phase-field models.

  abstract: Graph neural cellular automata are a recently introduced class of computational
    models that extend neural cellular automata to arbitrary graphs. They are promising
    in various applications based on preliminary test results and the successes of
    related computational models, such as neural cellular automata and convolutional
    and graph neural networks. However, all previous graph neural cellular automaton
    implementations have only been able to modify data associated with the vertices
    and edges, not the underlying graph topology itself. Here we introduce a method
    of encoding graph topology information as vertex data by assigning each edge and
    vertex an opacity value, which is the confidence with which the model thinks that
    that edge or vertex should be present in the output graph. Graph neural cellular
    automata equipped with this encoding method, henceforth referred to as translucent
    graph neural cellular automata, were tested in their ability to learn to reconstruct
    graphs from random subgraphs of them as a proof of concept. The results suggest
    that translucent graph neural cellular automata are capable of this task, albeit
    with optimal learning rates highly dependent on the graph to be reconstructed.

    Despite the models not being explicitly trained for mutation or inheritability,
    the descendant patterns exponentially drift away from ancestral patterns, even

    of evolutionary dynamics in a cellular automaton, it is the first to do so by

  abstract: Abstract. As opposed to the traditional view wherein intelligence was
    believed to be a result of centralised complex monolithic rules, it is now believed
    that the phenomenon is multi-scale, modular and emergent (self-organising) in
    nature. At each scale, the constituents of an intelligent system are cognitive
    units driven towards a specific goal, in a specific problem space—physical, molecular,
    metabolic, morphological, etc. Recently, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have proven
    to be effective in simulating many evolutionary tasks, in morphological space,
    as self-organising dynamical systems. They are however limited in their capacity
    to emulate complex phenomena seen in nature such as cell differentiation (change
    in cell’s phenotypical and functional characteristics), metamorphosis (transformation
    to a new morphology after evolving to another) and apoptosis (programmed cell
    death). Inspired by the idea of multi-scale emergence of intelligence, we present
    Hierarchical NCA, a self-organising model that allows for phased, feedback-based,
    complex emergent behaviour. We show that by modelling emergent behaviour at two
    different scales in a modular hierarchy with dedicated goals, we can effectively
    simulate many complex evolutionary morphological tasks. Finally, we discuss the
    broader impact and application of this concept in areas outside biological process
    modelling.

    Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are an extension of traditional CA, where the transition

    a platform for investigating more biologically plausible features of emergent
    intelligence. However, an open question is how can collections of cells in an

    and find suitable paths to collect them. In this work, we utilize an NCA equipped

    Our results show that NCA can be trained to achieve such task and collect energy

  abstract: The problem of generating microstructures of complex materials in silico
    has been approached from various directions including simulation, Markov, deep
    learning and descriptor-based approaches. This work presents a hybrid method that
    is inspired by all four categories and has interesting scalability properties.
    A neural cellular automaton is trained to evolve microstructures based on local
    information. Unlike most machine learning-based approaches, it does not directly
    require a data set of reference micrographs, but is trained from statistical microstructure
    descriptors that can stem from a single reference. This means that the training
    cost scales only with the complexity of the structure and associated descriptors.
    Since the size of the reconstructed structures can be set during inference, even
    extremely large structures can be efficiently generated. Similarly, the method
    is very efficient if many structures are to be reconstructed from the same descriptor
    for statistical evaluations. The method is formulated and discussed in detail
    by means of various numerical experiments, demonstrating its utility and scalability.

  abstract: We study the problem of generating arbitrarily large environments to improve
    the throughput of multi-robot systems. Prior work proposes Quality Diversity (QD)
    algorithms as an effective method for optimizing the environments of automated
    warehouses. However, these approaches optimize only relatively small environments,
    falling short when it comes to replicating real-world warehouse sizes. The challenge
    arises from the exponential increase in the search space as the environment size
    increases. Additionally, the previous methods have only been tested with up to
    350 robots in simulations, while practical warehouses could host thousands of
    robots. In this paper, instead of optimizing environments, we propose to optimize
    Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) environment generators via QD algorithms. We train
    a collection of NCA generators with QD algorithms in small environments and then
    generate arbitrarily large environments from the generators at test time. We show
    that NCA environment generators maintain consistent, regularized patterns regardless
    of environment size, significantly enhancing the scalability of multi-robot systems
    in two different domains with up to 2,350 robots. Additionally, we demonstrate
    that our method scales a single-agent reinforcement learning policy to arbitrarily
    large environments with similar patterns. We include the source code at \url{https://github.com/lunjohnzhang/warehouse_env_gen_nca_public}.

  abstract: Modeling and synthesizing textures are essential for enhancing the realism
    of virtual environments. Methods that directly synthesize textures in 3D offer
    distinct advantages to the UV-mapping-based methods as they can create seamless
    textures and align more closely with the ways textures form in nature. We propose
    Mesh Neural Cellular Automata (MeshNCA), a method for directly synthesizing dynamic
    textures on 3D meshes without requiring any UV maps. MeshNCA is a generalized
    type of cellular automata that can operate on a set of cells arranged on a non-grid
    structure such as vertices of a 3D mesh. While only being trained on an Icosphere
    mesh, MeshNCA shows remarkable generalization and can synthesize textures on any
    mesh in real time after the training. Additionally, it accommodates multi-modal
    supervision and can be trained using different targets such as images, text prompts,
    and motion vector fields. Moreover, we conceptualize a way of grafting trained
    MeshNCA instances, enabling texture interpolation. Our MeshNCA model enables real-time
    3D texture synthesis on meshes and allows several user interactions including
    texture density/orientation control, a grafting brush, and motion speed/direction
    control. Finally, we implement the forward pass of our MeshNCA model using the
    WebGL shading language and showcase our trained models in an online interactive
    demo which is accessible on personal computers and smartphones. Our demo and the

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the
    update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient
    descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where
    the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing
    reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain
    is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE.
    However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by
    the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains
    an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization
    approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training
    discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called
    "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as
    the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving
    the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities.
    Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous
    control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns.
    We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals
    that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research
    from a dynamical systems' perspective.

  abstract: We use the Quality Diversity (QD) algorithm with Neural Cellular Automata
    (NCA) to generate benchmark maps for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms.
    Previously, MAPF algorithms are tested using fixed, human-designed benchmark maps.
    However, such fixed benchmark maps have several problems. First, these maps may
    not cover all the potential failure scenarios for the algorithms. Second, when
    comparing different algorithms, fixed benchmark maps may introduce bias leading
    to unfair comparisons between algorithms. In this work, we take advantage of the
    QD algorithm and NCA with different objectives and diversity measures to generate
    maps with patterns to comprehensively understand the performance of MAPF algorithms
    and be able to make fair comparisons between two MAPF algorithms to provide further
    information on the selection between two algorithms. Empirically, we employ this
    technique to generate diverse benchmark maps to evaluate and compare the behavior
    of different types of MAPF algorithms such as bounded-suboptimal algorithms, suboptimal
    algorithms, and reinforcement-learning-based algorithms. Through both single-planner
    experiments and comparisons between algorithms, we identify patterns where each
    algorithm excels and detect disparities in runtime or success rates between different

  abstract: Medical image registration is a critical process that aligns various patient
    scans, facilitating tasks like diagnosis, surgical planning, and tracking. Traditional
    optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques,
    such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However,
    these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these
    challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends
    DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural
    Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient
    image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells
    and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living
    systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across
    three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus
    images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's
    ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes
    itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60%
    and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph

  abstract: Continual learning (CL) in medical imaging presents a unique challenge,
    requiring models to adapt to new domains while retaining previously acquired knowledge.
    We introduce NCAdapt, a Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) based method designed to
    address this challenge. NCAdapt features a domain-specific multi-head structure,
    integrating adaptable convolutional layers into the NCA backbone for each new
    domain encountered. After initial training, the NCA backbone is frozen, and only
    the newly added adaptable convolutional layers, consisting of 384 parameters,
    are trained along with domain-specific NCA convolutions. We evaluate NCAdapt on
    hippocampus segmentation tasks, benchmarking its performance against Lifelong
    nnU-Net and U-Net models with state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods. Our lightweight
    approach achieves SOTA performance, underscoring its effectiveness in addressing
    CL challenges in medical imaging. Upon acceptance, we will make our code base
    publicly accessible to support reproducibility and foster further advancements
    in medical CL.

  abstract: Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) are widely used for high-quality image
    generation and medical image segmentation but often rely on Unet-based architectures,
    leading to high computational overhead, especially with high-resolution images.
    This work proposes three NCA-based improvements for diffusion-based medical image
    segmentation. First, Multi-MedSegDiffNCA uses a multilevel NCA framework to refine
    rough noise estimates generated by lower level NCA models. Second, CBAM-MedSegDiffNCA
    incorporates channel and spatial attention for improved segmentation. Third, MultiCBAM-MedSegDiffNCA
    combines these methods with a new RGB channel loss for semantic guidance. Evaluations
    on Lesion segmentation show that MultiCBAM-MedSegDiffNCA matches Unet-based model
    performance with dice score of 87.84% while using 60-110 times fewer parameters,
    offering a more efficient solution for low resource medical settings.

  abstract: In Distributed Manipulator Systems (DMS), decentralization is a highly
    desirable property as it promotes robustness and facilitates scalability by distributing
    computational burden and eliminating singular points of failure. However, current
    DMS typically utilize a centralized approach to sensing, such as single-camera
    computer vision systems. This centralization poses a risk to system reliability
    and offers a significant limiting factor to system size. In this work, we introduce
    a decentralized approach for sensing and in a Distributed Manipulator Systems
    using Neural Cellular Automata (NCA). Demonstrating a decentralized sensing in
    a hardware implementation, we present a novel inductive sensor board designed
    for distributed sensing and evaluate its ability to estimate global object properties,
    such as the geometric center, through local interactions and computations. Experiments
    demonstrate that NCA-based sensing networks accurately estimate object position
    at 0.24 times the inter sensor distance. They maintain resilience under sensor
    faults and noise, and scale seamlessly across varying network sizes. These findings
    underscore the potential of local, decentralized computations to enable scalable,
    fault-tolerant, and noise-resilient object property estimation in DMS

  abstract: The cellular automata is a discrete mathematical model of computation
    that consists of a regular grid of cells, each being in one of the finite number
    of states, with its next iteration determined by a set of rules applied locally
    at each cell. Traditionally those rules are predefined and crafted for a specific,
    desired operation, though recently it has been shown that they can also be learned
    with convolutional neural networks and applied to perform image classification
    or segmentation. The locality of the computation and presence of independent and
    organised agents resembles the architecture of the Focal Plane Sensor Processors
    (FPSP), a family of vision chips where every pixel/photo-diode in the array is
    equipped with a processing unit allowing for computations directly on a focal
    plane. In this thesis, we investigate the suitability of FPSP architectures for
    hosting the neural cellular automata (NCA) by implementing an example automaton
    for the self-classification of MNIST digits. In the process, we present a comprehensive
    analysis of the computational and memory requirements of the NCA and relates them
    to the capabilities of existing FPSP devices, providing guidelines for the development
    of automata that is less resource consuming. We develop a step-by-step quantisation
    procedure customised for the application of neural cellular automata on FPSP,
    which reduces the 32-bit floating-point model into the integer representation
    with 5-bit weights, 10-bit input and 9-bit activations while entirely maintaining
    its performance and precision. Our implementation of this quantised NCA achieves
    an operation at 74 FPS with using 77.68 mJ energy per frame on the simulated FPSP
    device. This work could also be treated as an exploration of neural cellular automata
    as a potential general computation algorithm for the FPSP family architectures
    and also as an exploration for the possible development directions of the next
    generation of FPSPs. Hence, we conclude this thesis with a discussion on the discovered
    bottlenecks and limitations and describing the ideas on possible solutions, such
    as more sophisticated patch multiplexing/superpixels.

  abstract: 'Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs) are a form of modular soft robots, composed
    of several deformable cubes, i.e., voxels. Each VSR is thus an ensemble of simple
    agents, namely the voxels, which must cooperate to give rise to the overall VSR
    behavior. Within this paradigm, collective intelligence plays a key role in enabling
    the emerge of coordination, as each voxel is independently controlled, exploiting
    only the local sensory information together with some knowledge passed from its
    direct neighbors (distributed or collective control). In this work, we propose
    a novel form of collective control, inﬂuenced by Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)
    and based on the bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks: the embodied Spiking NCA
    (SNCA). We experiment with different variants of SNCA, and ﬁnd them to be competitive
    with the state-of-the-art distributed controllers for the task of locomotion.
    In addition, our ﬁndings show signiﬁcant improvement with respect to the baseline
    in terms of adaptability to unforeseen environmental changes, which could be a

  abstract: Lately, studying social dynamics in interacting agents has been boosted
    by the power of computer models, which bring the richness of qualitative work,
    while offering the precision, transparency, extensiveness, and replicability of
    statistical and mathematical approaches. A particular set of phenomena for the
    study of social dynamics is Web collaborative platforms. A dataset of interest
    is r/place, a collaborative social experiment held in 2017 on Reddit, which consisted
    of a shared online canvas of 1000 pixels by 1000 pixels co-edited by over a million
    recorded users over 72 hours. In this paper, we designed and compared two methods
    to analyze the dynamics of this experiment. Our ﬁrst method consisted in approximating
    the set of 2D cellular-automata-like rules used to generate the canvas images
    and how these rules change over time. The second method consisted in a convolutional
    neural network (CNN) that learned an approximation to the generative rules in
    order to generate the complex outcomes of the canvas. Our results indicate varying
    context-size dependencies for the predictability of different objects in r/place
    in time and space. They also indicate a surprising peak in difﬁculty to statistically
    infer behavioral rules towards the middle of the social experiment, while user
    interactions did not drop until before the end. The combination of our two approaches,
    one rule-based and the other statistical CNN-based, shows the ability to highlight
    diverse aspects of analyzing social dynamics.

  abstract: Abstract. Chemotaxis is a phenomenon whereby organisms like ameba direct
    their movements responding to their environmental gradients, often called gradient
    climbing. It is considered to be the origin of self-movement that characterizes
    life forms. In this work, we have simulated the gradient climbing behaviour on
    Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) that has recently been proposed as a model to simulate
    morphogenesis. NCA is a cellular automata model using deep networks for its learnable
    update rule and it generates a target cell pattern from a single cell through
    local interactions among cells. Our model, Gradient Climbing Neural Cellular Automata
    (GCNCA), has an additional feature that enables itself to move a generated pattern
    by responding to a gradient injected into its cell states.

  abstract: Rapid advancements in deep learning over the past decade have fueled an
    insatiable demand for efficient and scalable hardware. Photonics offers a promising
    solution by leveraging the unique properties of light. However, conventional neural
    network architectures, which typically require dense programmable connections,
    pose several practical challenges for photonic realizations. To overcome these
    limitations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate Photonic Neural Cellular
    Automata (PNCA) for photonic deep learning with sparse connectivity. PNCA harnesses
    the speed and interconnectivity of photonics, as well as the self-organizing nature
    of cellular automata through local interactions to achieve robust, reliable, and
    efficient processing. We utilize linear light interference and parametric nonlinear
    optics for all-optical computations in a time-multiplexed photonic network to
    experimentally perform self-organized image classification. We demonstrate binary
    classification of images in the fashion-MNIST dataset using as few as 3 programmable
    photonic parameters, achieving an experimental accuracy of 98.0% with the ability
    to also recognize out-of-distribution data. The proposed PNCA approach can be
    adapted to a wide range of existing photonic hardware and provides a compelling
    alternative to conventional photonic neural networks by maximizing the advantages
    of light-based computing whilst mitigating their practical challenges. Our results
    showcase the potential of PNCA in advancing photonic deep learning and highlights
    a path for next-generation photonic computers.

  abstract: Neural cellular automata have been proven effective in simulating morphogenetic
    processes. Developing such automata has been applied in 2D and 3D processes related
    to creating and regenerating complex structures and enabling their behaviors.
    However, neural cellular automata are inherently uncontrollable after the training
    process. Starting from a neural cellular automaton trained to generate a given
    shape from one living cell, this paper aims to gain insight into the behavior
    of the automaton, and to analyze the influence of the different image characteristics
    on the training and stabilization process and its shortcomings in different scenarios.
    For each considered shape, the automaton is trained on one RGB image of size 72
    \times 72 pixels containing the shape on an uniform white background, in which
    each pixel represents a cell. The evolution of the automaton starts from one living
    cell, employing a shallow neural network for the update rule, followed by backpropagation
    after a variable number of evolutionary steps. We studied the behavior of the
    automaton and the way in which different components like symmetry, orientation
    and colours of the shape influence its growth and alteration after a number of
    epochs and discussed this thoroughly in the experimental section of the paper.
    We further discuss a pooling strategy, used to stabilize the model and illustrate
    the influence of this pooling on the training process. The benefits of this strategy
    are compared to the original model and the behavior of the automaton during its
    evolution is studied in detail. Finally, we compare the results of models using
    different filters in the first stage of feature selection. The main results of
    our study are the insights gained into how the neural cellular automaton works,
    what it is actually learning, and what influence this learning, as there are observable
    result differences depending on the characteristics of the input images and the
    filters used in the model.

  abstract: Neural cellular automata represent an evolution of the traditional cellular

    function. This shift from a manual to a datadriven approach significantly increases
    the adaptability of these models, enabling their application in diverse domains,
    including content generation and artificial life. However, their widespread application
    has been hampered by significant computational requirements. In this work, we
    introduce the Latent Neural Cellular Automata (LNCA) model, a novel architecture
    designed to address the resource limitations of neural cellular automata. Our
    approach shifts the computation from the conventional input space to a specially
    designed latent space, relying on a pre-trained autoencoder. We apply our model
    in the context of image restoration, which aims to reconstruct high-quality images
    from their degraded versions. This modification not only reduces the model’s resource
    consumption but also maintains a flexible framework suitable for various applications.
    Our model achieves a significant reduction in computational requirements while
    maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. This increase in efficiency allows for
    inputs up to 16 times larger than current state-of-the-art neural cellular automata
    models, using the same resources.

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a powerful combination of machine learning
    and mechanistic modelling. We train NCA to learn complex dynamics from time series
    of images and Partial Differential Equation (PDE) trajectories. Our method is
    designed to identify underlying local rules that govern large scale dynamic emergent
    behaviours. Previous work on NCA focuses on learning rules that give stationary
    emergent structures. We extend NCA to capture both transient and stable structures
    within the same system, as well as learning rules that capture the dynamics of
    Turing pattern formation in nonlinear PDEs. We demonstrate that NCA can generalise
    very well beyond their PDE training data, we show how to constrain NCA to respect
    given symmetries, and we explore the effects of associated hyperparameters on
    model performance and stability. Being able to learn arbitrary dynamics gives
    NCA great potential as a data driven modelling framework, especially for modelling
    biological pattern formation.

    global communication early in the diffusion process. This feature is particularly
    valuable in synthesizing complex images with important global features, such as
    the CelebA dataset. We demonstrate that even a 331k parameter Diff-NCA can generate

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) models are trainable variations of traditional
    Cellular Automata (CA). Emergent motion in the patterns created by NCA has been
    successfully applied to synthesize dynamic textures. However, the conditions required
    for an NCA to display dynamic patterns remain unexplored. Here, we investigate
    the relationship between the NCA architecture and the emergent dynamics of the
    trained models. Specifically, we vary the number of channels in the cell state
    and the number of hidden neurons in the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), and draw
    a relationship between the combination of these two variables and the motion strength
    between successive frames. Our analysis reveals that the disparity and proportionality
    between these two variables have a strong correlation with the emergent dynamics
    in the NCA output. We thus propose a design principle for creating dynamic NCA.

  abstract: The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has spurred global collaborative research
    efforts to model and forecast the disease to improve preparation and control.
    Epidemiological models integrate experimental data and expert opinions to understand
    infection dynamics and control measures. Classical Machine Learning techniques
    often face challenges such as high data requirements, lack of interpretability,
    and difficulty integrating domain knowledge. A potential solution is to leverage
    Physically-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) models, which enhance models by incorporating
    known physical properties of viral spread. Additionally, epidemiological datasets
    are best represented as graphs, facilitating the modelling of interactions between
    individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel, interpretable graph-based PIML
    technique called SINDy-Graph to model infectious disease dynamics. Our approach
    is a Graph Cellular Automata architecture that combines the ability to identify
    dynamics for discovering the differential equations governing the physical phenomena
    under study using graphs modelling relationships between nodes (individuals).
    The experimental results demonstrate that integrating domain knowledge ensures
    better physical plausibility. In addition, our proposed model is easier to train
    and achieves a lower generalisation error compared to other baseline methods.

  abstract: 'Generative modeling seeks to approximate the statistical properties of
    real data, enabling synthesis of new data that closely resembles the original
    distribution. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
    Models (DDPMs) represent significant advancements in generative modeling, drawing
    inspiration from game theory and thermodynamics, respectively. Nevertheless, the
    exploration of generative modeling through the lens of biological evolution remains
    largely untapped. In this paper, we introduce a novel family of models termed
    Generative Cellular Automata (GeCA), inspired by the evolution of an organism
    from a single cell. GeCAs are evaluated as an effective augmentation tool for
    retinal disease classification across two imaging modalities: Fundus and Optical
    Coherence Tomography (OCT). In the context of OCT imaging, where data is scarce
    and the distribution of classes is inherently skewed, GeCA significantly boosts
    the performance of 11 different ophthalmological conditions, achieving a 12% increase
    in the average F1 score compared to conventional baselines. GeCAs outperform both

  abstract: Much is unknown about how living systems grow into, coordinate communication
    across, and maintain themselves as hierarchical arrangements of semi-independent
    cells, tissues, organs, and entire bodies, where each component at each level
    has its own goals and sensor, motor, and communication capabilities. Similar uncertainty
    surrounds exactly how selection acts on the components across these levels. Finally,
    growing interest in viewing intelligence not as something localized to the brain
    but rather distributed across biological hierarchies has renewed investigation
    into the nature of such hierarchies. Here we show that organizing neural cellular
    automata (NCAs) into a hierarchical structure can improve the ability to evolve
    them to perform morphogenesis and homeostasis, compared to non-hierarchical NCAs.
    The increased evolvability of hierarchical NCAs (HNCAs) compared to non-hierarchical
    NCAs suggests an evolutionary advantage to the formation and utilization of higher-order
    structures, across larger spatial scales, for some tasks, and suggests new ways
    to design and optimize NCA models and hierarchical arrangements of robots. The
    results presented here demonstrate the value of explicitly incorporating hierarchical
    structure into systems that must grow and maintain complex patterns. The introduced
    method may also serve as a platform to further investigate the evolutionary dynamics

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have proven to be effective in a variety
    of fields, with numerous biologically inspired applications. One of the fields,
    in which NCAs perform well is the generation of textures, modelling global patterns
    from local interactions governed by uniform and coherent rules. This paper aims
    to enhance the usability of NCAs in texture synthesis by addressing a shortcoming
    of current NCA architectures for texture generation, which requires separately
    trained NCA for each individual texture. In this work, we train a single NCA for
    the evolution of multiple textures, based on individual examples. Our solution
    provides texture information in the state of each cell, in the form of an internally
    coded genomic signal, which enables the NCA to generate the expected texture.
    Such a neural cellular automaton not only maintains its regenerative capability
    but also allows for interpolation between learned textures and supports grafting
    techniques. This demonstrates the ability to edit generated textures and the potential
    for them to merge and coexist within the same automaton. We also address questions
    related to the influence of the genomic information and the cost function on the
    evolution of the NCA.

  abstract: Abstract. This paper introduces a Gene Regulatory Neural Cellular Automata
    (ENIGMA), an innovative extension of the Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) framework
    aimed at modeling biological development with a greater degree of biological fidelity.
    Traditional NCAs, while capable of generating complex patterns through neural
    network-driven update rules, lack mechanisms that closely mimic biological processes
    such as cell-cell signaling and gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Our ENIGMA model
    addresses these limitations by incorporating update rules based on a simulated
    gene regulatory network driven by cell-cell signaling, optimized both through
    backpropagation and genetic algorithms. We demonstrate the structure and functionality
    of ENIGMA through various experiments, comparing its performance and properties
    with those of natural organisms. Our findings reveal that ENIGMA can successfully
    simulate complex cellular networks and exhibit phenomena such as homeotic transformations,
    pattern maintenance in variable tissue sizes, and the formation of simple regulatory
    motifs akin to those observed in developmental biology. The introduction of ENIGMA
    represents a significant step towards bridging the gap between computational models
    and the intricacies of biological development, offering a versatile tool for exploring
    developmental and evolutionary questions with profound implications for understanding
    gene regulation, pattern formation, and the emergent behavior of complex systems.

  abstract: The disparity in access to machine learning tools for medical imaging
    across different regions significantly limits the potential for universal healthcare
    innovation, particularly in remote areas. Our research addresses this issue by
    implementing Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) training directly on smartphones for
    accessible X-ray lung segmentation. We confirm the practicality and feasibility
    of deploying and training these advanced models on five Android devices, improving
    medical diagnostics accessibility and bridging the tech divide to extend machine
    learning benefits in medical imaging to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
    We further enhance this approach with an unsupervised adaptation method using
    the novel Variance-Weighted Segmentation Loss (VWSL), which efficiently learns
    from unlabeled data by minimizing the variance from multiple NCA predictions.
    This strategy notably improves model adaptability and performance across diverse
    medical imaging contexts without the need for extensive computational resources
    or labeled datasets, effectively lowering the participation threshold. Our methodology,
    tested on three multisite X-ray datasets—Padchest, ChestX-ray8, and MIMIC-III—demonstrates
    improvements in segmentation Dice accuracy by 0.7 to 2.8%, compared to the classic
    Med-NCA. Additionally, in extreme cases where no digital copy is available and
    images must be captured by a phone from an X-ray lightbox or monitor, VWSL enhances
    Dice accuracy by 5-20%, demonstrating the method’s robustness even with suboptimal
    image sources.

  abstract: Skin melanoma is one of the most dangerous tumor lesions. In recent years,
    the number of cases and deaths caused by melanoma has been increasing. The discovery
    and segmentation of the lesion area are crucial for the timely diagnosis and treatment
    of melanoma. However, the lesion area is often similar to the healthy area, and
    the size scale changes greatly, which makes the segmentation of the skin lesion
    area a very challenging task. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a model that can
    be described as a recurrent convolutional network. It achieves global consistency
    through multiple local information exchanges, thereby completing the processing
    of information. Recent research on NCA shows that such a local interactive model
    can segment low-resolution images well. However, for high-resolution images, direct
    use of NCA for processing is limited by high memory requirements and difficulty
    in model convergence. In this paper, in order to overcome these limitations, we
    propose a new NCA-based segmentation model, named UNCA. UNCA is a model with a
    U-shaped structure. The high-resolution image is down-sampled to obtain high-dimensional
    low-resolution features, which are then input into the NCA for information processing.
    Finally, the image size is restored by upsampling. The experimental results show
    that the UNCA proposed in this paper has achieved good results on the ISIC2017
    dataset, surpassing most of the current methods.

  abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) demonstrate remarkable performance in image
    classification through visual-token interaction learning, particularly when equipped
    with local information via region attention or convolutions. Although such architectures
    improve the feature aggregation from different granularities, they often fail
    to contribute to the robustness of the networks. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)
    enables the modeling of global visual-token representations through local interactions,
    with its training strategies and architecture design conferring strong generalization
    ability and robustness against noisy input. In this paper, we propose Adaptor
    Neural Cellular Automata (AdaNCA) for Vision Transformers that uses NCA as plug-and-play
    adaptors between ViT layers, thus enhancing ViT's performance and robustness against
    adversarial samples as well as out-of-distribution inputs. To overcome the large
    computational overhead of standard NCAs, we propose Dynamic Interaction for more
    efficient interaction learning. Using our analysis of AdaNCA placement and robustness
    improvement, we also develop an algorithm for identifying the most effective insertion
    points for AdaNCA. With less than a 3% increase in parameters, AdaNCA contributes
    to more than 10% absolute improvement in accuracy under adversarial attacks on
    the ImageNet1K benchmark. Moreover, we demonstrate with extensive evaluations
    across eight robustness benchmarks and four ViT architectures that AdaNCA, as
    a plug-and-play module, consistently improves the robustness of ViTs.

    (CA) model, we achieve millisecond-level computational efficiency, significantly
    outperforming traditional CPU-based wildfire simulators on real-world-scale fires
    at high resolution. Real-time parameter calibration is made possible through gradient
    descent on our model, aligning simulations closely with observed wildfire behavior
    both temporally and spatially, thereby enhancing the realism of the simulations.
    Our PyTorchFire simulator, combined with real-world environmental data, demonstrates
    superior generalizability compared to supervised learning surrogate models. Its
    ability to predict and calibrate wildfire behavior in real-time ensures accuracy,

  abstract: Cellular automata have become a cornerstone for investigating emergence
    and self-organization across diverse scientific disciplines. However, the absence
    of a hardware-accelerated cellular automata library limits the exploration of
    new research directions, hinders collaboration, and impedes reproducibility. In
    this work, we introduce CAX (Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX), a high-performance
    and flexible open-source library designed to accelerate cellular automata research.
    CAX delivers cutting-edge performance through hardware acceleration while maintaining
    flexibility through its modular architecture, intuitive API, and support for both
    discrete and continuous cellular automata in arbitrary dimensions. We demonstrate
    CAX’s performance and flexibility through a wide range of benchmarks and applications.
    From classic models like elementary cellular automata and Conway’s Game of Life
    to advanced applications such as growing neural cellular automata and self-classifying
    MNIST digits, CAX speeds up simulations up to 2,000 times faster. Furthermore,
    we demonstrate CAX’s potential to accelerate research by presenting a collection
    of three novel cellular automata experiments, each implemented in just a few lines
    of code thanks to the library’s modular architecture. Notably, we show that a
    simple one-dimensional cellular automaton can outperform GPT-4 on the 1D-ARC challenge.

    the environment. To explore how sensor movement impacts behavior in image classification
    tasks, we introduce the Active Neural Cellular Automata (ANCA), a neocortex-inspired
    model with movable sensors. Active sensing naturally emerges in the ANCA, with
    belief-informed exploration and attentive behavior to salient information, without
    adding explicit attention mechanisms. Active sensing both simplifies classification
    tasks and leads to a highly scalable system. This enables ANCAs to be smaller
    than the image size without losing information and enables fault tolerance to
    damaged sensors. Overall, our work provides insight to how distributed architectures
    can interact with movement, opening new avenues for adaptive AI systems in embodied

  abstract: 'Purpose: Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is a non-invasive imaging method
    for the entire gastrointestinal tract, and is a pain-free alternative to traditional
    endoscopy. It generates extensive video data that requires significant review
    time, and localizing the capsule after ingestion is a challenge. Techniques like
    bleeding detection and depth estimation can help with localization of pathologies,
    but deep learning models are typically too large to run directly on the capsule.

    Methods: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) for bleeding segmentation and depth estimation
    are trained on capsule endoscopic images. For monocular depth estimation, we distill
    a large foundation model into the lean NCA architecture, by treating the outputs
    of the foundation model as pseudo ground truth. We then port the trained NCAs
    to the ESP32 microcontroller, enabling efficient image processing on hardware
    as small as a camera capsule.

    Results: NCAs are more accurate (Dice) than other portable segmentation models,
    while requiring more than 100x fewer parameters stored in memory than other small-scale
    models. The visual results of NCAs depth estimation look convincing, and in some
    cases beat the realism and detail of the pseudo ground truth. Runtime optimizations
    on the ESP32-S3 accelerate the average inference speed significantly, by more
    than factor 3.

    Conclusion: With several algorithmic adjustments and distillation, it is possible
    to eNCApsulate NCA models into microcontrollers that fit into wireless capsule
    endoscopes. This is the first work that enables reliable bleeding segmentation
    and depth estimation on a miniaturized device, paving the way for precise diagnosis
    combined with visual odometry as a means of precise localization of the capsule

  abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate
    complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like
    Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements
    have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question
    of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel,
    neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned
    via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential
    of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton
    through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model,
    objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata
    toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate
    the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix
    multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network
    solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata

  abstract: A layman in health systems is a person who doesn’t have any knowledge
    about health data i.e., X-ray, MRI, CT scan, and health examination reports, etc.
    The motivation behind the proposed invention is to help laymen to make medical
    images understandable. The health model is trained using a neural network approach
    that analyses user health examination data; predicts the type and level of the
    disease and advises precaution to the user. Cellular Automata (CA) technology
    has been integrated with the neural networks to segment the medical image. The
    CA analyzes the medical images pixel by pixel and generates a robust threshold
    value which helps to efficiently segment the image and identify accurate abnormal
    spots from the medical image. The proposed method has been trained and experimented
    using 10000+ medical images which are taken from various open datasets. Various
    text analysis measures i.e., BLEU, ROUGE, and WER are used in the research to
    validate the produced report. The BLEU and ROUGE calculate a similarity to decide
    how the generated text report is closer to the original report. The BLEU and ROUGE
    scores of the experimented images are approximately 0.62 and 0.90, claims that
    the produced report is very close to the original report. The WER score 0.14,
    claims that the generated report contains the most relevant words. The overall
    summary of the proposed research is that it provides a fruitful medical report
    with accurate disease and precautions to the laymen.

  abstract: 'This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic
    CA), a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable
    Logic Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
    differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
    is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at inference
    time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables learning local
    update rules for cellular automata while preserving their inherent discrete nature.
    We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through a series of milestones:
    (1) fully learning the rules of Conway''s Game of Life, (2) generating checkerboard
    patterns that exhibit resilience to noise and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape,
    and (4) multi-color pattern generation. Our model successfully learns recurrent
    circuits capable of generating desired target patterns. For simpler patterns,
    we observe success with both synchronous and asynchronous updates, demonstrating
    significant generalization capabilities and robustness to perturbations. We make
    the case that this combination of DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable
    matter and robust computing systems that combine binary logic, neural network
    adaptability, and localized processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge,
    is the first successful application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent

  abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular
    Automata (NCA), are highly expressive and capable of surprisingly complex behaviors.
    This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring precise transformations
    and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial
    General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that challenges their capabilities
    in ways not previously explored. Specifically, this paper uses gradient-based
    training to learn iterative update rules that transform input grids into their
    outputs from the training examples and apply them to the test inputs. Results
    suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a promising and efficient approach
    to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from ARC. Along with discussing the impacts
    of various design modifications and training constraints, this work examines the
    behavior and properties of NCAs applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications
    of self-organizing systems.

  abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a fundamental 
    challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring solutions that exhibit robust 
    abstraction and reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) 
    correct examples are presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence 
    systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a developmental approach 
    leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) 
    to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex 
    dynamics and emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological systems. 
    Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing AI's problem-solving capabilities 
    beyond mere training data extrapolation. ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles 
    into computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show that our ARC-NCA

    MNCAs can model diverse local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics
    observed in biological processes. We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three

    image morphogenesis robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results
    show that MNCAs achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate
    real biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation.
    These findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
    systems and studying self-growth processes.'

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
    cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly applying
    simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including self-regeneration,
    generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and spontaneous motion. Despite
    their success in texture synthesis and morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined
    to low-resolution grids. This limitation stems from (1) training time and memory
    requirements that grow quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation
    of information which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy
    compute demands of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome
    this limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired
    by recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution
    on a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary resolution.
    We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and texture synthesis
    tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with minimal memory and
    computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture and loss functions brings
    substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and performance. NCAs equipped
    with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD outputs in real time while preserving
    their self-organizing, emergent properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes
    cell states independently, inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient.
    We demonstrate the applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants
    (on 2D, 3D grids, and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation
    and morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
    framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal computational
    overhead.

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) offer a way to study the growth of two-dimensional
    artificial organisms from a single seed cell. From the outset, NCA-grown organisms
    have had issues with stability, their natural boundary often breaking down and
    exhibiting tumour-like growth or failing to maintain the expected shape. In this
    paper, we present a method for improving the stability of NCA-grown organisms
    by introducing an 'identity' layer with simple constraints during training. Results
    show that NCAs grown in close proximity are more stable compared with the original
    NCA model. Moreover, only a single identity value is required to achieve this
    increase in stability. We observe emergent movement from the stable organisms,
    with increasing prevalence for models with multiple identity values. This work
    lays the foundation for further study of the interaction between NCA-grown organisms,
    paving the way for studying social interaction at a cellular level in artificial
    organisms.

  abstract: Criticality is a behavioral state in dynamical systems that is known to
    present the highest computation capabilities, i.e., information transmission,
    storage, and modification. Therefore, such systems are ideal candidates as a substrate
    for reservoir computing, a subfield in artificial intelligence. Our choice of
    a substrate is a cellular automaton (CA) governed by an artificial neural network,
    also known as neural cellular automaton (NCA). We apply evolution strategy to
    optimize the NCA to achieve criticality, demonstrated by power law distributions
    in structures called avalanches. With an evolved critical NCA, the substrate is
    tested for reservoir computing. Our evaluation of the substrate is performed with
    two benchmarks, 5-bit memory task and image classification of handwritten digits.
    The result of the 5-bit memory task achieved a perfect score and the system managed
    to remember all 5 bits. The result for the image classification task matched and
    sometimes surpassed the performance of the best elementary CA for this task. Moreover,
    the proposed critical NCA may operate as a self-organized critical system, due
    to its robustness to extreme initial conditions.

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) offer a robust and interpretable approach

    However, a performance gap remains between NCA and larger, more complex architectures.
    We address this challenge by integrating attention pooling with NCA to enhance
    feature extraction and improve classification accuracy. The attention pooling
    mechanism refines the focus on the most informative regions, leading to more accurate
    predictions. We evaluate our method on eight diverse microscopy image datasets
    and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing NCA methods
    while remaining parameter-efficient and explainable. Furthermore, we compare our
    method with traditional lightweight convolutional neural network and vision transformer
    architectures, showing improved performance while maintaining a significantly
    lower parameter count. Our results highlight the potential of NCA-based models

    large amounts of labeled data, which is both time-consuming and expensive to acquire.
    In this work, we propose a novel approach for weakly supervised segmentation using
    neural cellular automata (NCA-WSS). By leveraging the feature maps generated by
    NCA during classification, we can extract segmentation masks without the need
    for retraining with segmentation labels. We evaluate our method on three white
    blood cell microscopy datasets and demonstrate that NCA-WSS significantly outperforms
    existing weakly supervised approaches. Our work illustrates the potential of NCA

  abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most
    painful problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored
    better and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
    evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of leveraging
    generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing version of
    famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative Adversarial Networks
    were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), a
    powerful computational model. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method
    that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based
    model is able to address the missing data imputation problem. We also provide
    several experiments to evidence that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
    in terms of imputation error and post-imputation performance.

  abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling
    biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with trainable,
    differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive self-regulatory
    dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as local
    decision-making centers and interaction rules between localized agents, NCA can
    simulate processes across molecular, cellular, tissue, and system-level scales,
    offering a multiscale competency architecture perspective on evolution, development,
    regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and robotic control. These models not only
    reproduce biologically inspired target patterns but also generalize to novel conditions,
    demonstrating robustness to perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation
    and reasoning. Given their immense success in recent developments, we here review
    current literature of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering
    applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust
    and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in
    controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on cutting-edge
    reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same principles of iterative
    state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative Artificial Intelligence (AI),
    such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their governing self-regulatory behavior
    is constraint to fully localized interactions, yet their collective behavior scales
    into coordinated system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying
    computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from
    multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design
    truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning and
    control.

  abstract: We present Mass-Conserving Evolution (MaCE), a general method for implementing
    mass conservation in Cellular Automata (CA). MaCE is a simple evolution rule that
    can be easily ’attached’ to existing CAs to make them mass-conserving, which tends
    to produce interesting behaviours more often, as patterns can no longer explode
    or die out. We first show that MaCE is numerically stable and admits a simple
    continuous limit. We then test MaCE on Lenia, and through several experiments,
    we demonstrate that it produces a wide variety of interesting behaviours, starting
    from the variety and abundance of solitons up to hints of intrinsic evolution
    in resourceconstrained environments. Finally, we showcase the versatility of MaCE
    by applying it to Neural-CAs and discrete CAs, and discuss promising research
    directions opened up by this scheme.

  abstract: 'Biological systems possess remarkable capabilities for self-recognition
    and morphological regeneration, often relying solely on local interactions. Inspired
    by these decentralized processes, we present a novel system of physical 3D bricks—simple
    cubic units equipped with local communication, processing, and sensing—that are
    capable of inferring their global shape class and detecting structural damage.
    Leveraging Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), a learned, fully-distributed algorithm,
    our system enables each module to independently execute the same neural network
    without access to any global state or positioning information. We demonstrate
    the ability of collections of hundreds of these cellular bricks to accurately
    classify a variety of 3D shapes through purely local interactions. The approach
    shows strong robustness to out-of-distribution shape variations and high tolerance
    to communication faults and failed modules. In addition to shape inference, the
    same decentralized framework is extended to detect missing or damaged components,

  abstract: With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein discovery,
    foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces promise to revolutionize
    many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus
    presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden
    of relying chiefly on manual design and trial-and-error to discover the configurations
    of lifelike simulations. This paper presents, for the first time, a successful
    realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach,
    called Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that
    produce target phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended
    novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations.
    Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range
    of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life, Lenia, and Neural
    Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique
    is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids lifeforms, as well as cellular
    automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game of Life. Additionally, the use
    of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a
    human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond
    what is possible through human ingenuity alone.

    work on physical NCA, we introduce key innovations that overcome limitations in

    enabling seamless connections between cells regardless of orientation. Additionally,
    each cell is battery-powered, allowing it to operate independently and retain
    its state even when disconnected from the collective. To demonstrate the platform''s
    applicability, we present a novel rotation-invariant NCA model for isotropic shape
    classification. The proposed system provides a robust foundation for exploring
    the physical realization of NCA, with potential applications in distributed robotic
    systems and self-organizing structures. Our implementation, including hardware,

  abstract: 'Artificial life simulations in search of open-endedness are often based on artificial evolution. 
    While such systems can generate complexity, gradient-based learning remains under-explored and may offer a 
    complementary path to open-endedness. We introduce Petri Dish Neural Cellular Automata (PD-NCA): 
    a differentiable multi-agent substrate consisting of a competitive population of neural cellular automata (NCA), 
    trained continuously as an artificial life simulation. Differentiable PD-NCA enable end-to-end learning in a 
    competitive, multi-agent system, which we hypothesize can induce open-ended complexification. Importantly, 
    and unlike typical NCA experiments, the models in our experiments are continuously learning through gradient 
    descent. Exploratory experiments demonstrate that PD-NCA show signs of emergent behavioral complexity and 
    cooperation. More broadly, our work introduces a new substrate where learning could potentially combine 
    with evolution to form open-ended systems.'

  abstract: 'Accurately predicting topologically correct masks remains a difficult
    task for general segmentation models, which often produce fragmented or disconnected
    outputs. Fixing these artifacts typically requires handcrafted refinement rules
    or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular
    Automata (NCA) can be directly repurposed as an effective refinement mechanism,
    using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation
    masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns
    the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information.
    When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively
    reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically
    consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to
    repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models
    and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2–3% gains in Dice/clDice
    and improves Betti Errors, reducing β0 errors by 60% and β1 by 20%; for myocardium,
    it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and
    HD by 19% and 16%, respectively. This showcases NCA as effective and broadly applicable
    refiners. Code available at www.github.com/maltesilber/rnca.'

  abstract: 'We present a self-organizing Neural Cellular Automaton (NCA) equipped
    with dynamic, learnable graph connectivity that adapts its computational topology
    in response to input history. The system exhibits history-dependent behavior:
    distinct input sequences induce divergent graph structures, enabling memory without
    explicit recurrence. We interpret the NCA as a fixed physical substrate (a lattice
    of identical units) that dynamically reconfigures its functional circuitry through
    edge modulation. We further propose a novel harmonic decoupling mechanism—mapping
    node activations to musical chords and traversing the circle of fifths between
    timesteps—to maximally decorrelate sequential representations, thereby reducing
    interference and enabling long-range communication across the graph. We argue
    that scaling such a system to brain-like dimensions (∼ 1011 nodes) with this decoupling
    paradigm could yield humanlevel learning efficiency, as the graph learns to specialize
    local neighborhoods for distinct computational roles. Experimental results on
    sequence transformation tasks confirm that different inputs follow distinct graph-evolution
    trajectories, demonstrating emergent memory bias and dynamic specialization.'

    music visualizer that is accessed through a web app, but performs inference entirely
    on local devices. Our approach enables anyone to create music-driven visuals while
    leveraging the expressive and sometimes unpredictable dynamics of self-organized
    systems. ADI uses an audio stream’s average energy (known as RMS) to modulate
    a neural cellular automata (NCA) that produces visual patterns that move and ’dance’
    along with the audio stream in real-time. Through the web interface, users can
    adjust the relationship between the music’s energy and the NCA system to create
    unique visual performances out of any music audio stream. ADI achieves smooth,
    real-time responsiveness on modern consumer devices.

  abstract: The exemplar-based stylization of dynamic 3D volume sequences remains
    challenging in computer graphics. The difficulty lies not only in maintaining
    the styling features concerning a reference image across multiviews and time frames,
    but also in preserving visually plausible motion as the original smoke simulation,
    within a reasonable time and computational resources. In this work, we introduce
    Volumetric Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), a novel method that synthesizes volumetric
    temporal textures for smoke stylizations in real-time. Our method formats radiance
    fields atop the self-emerging Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and generates a dynamic
    sequence of stylized color and density volumes. The synthesized temporal textures
    align with the input sequence’s overall motion patterns while matching the style
    of a reference image. We use flow-guided supervision to align the texture’s temporal
    motion with that of the perceived smoke sequence, reducing the training time by
    over an order of magnitude. We demonstrate that VNCA can be easily adapted for
    mesh stylization, akin to solid texture modeling, extending its application beyond
    dynamic volume simulations.

  abstract: Neural cellular automata (NCA) provide a powerful computational paradigm
    for modelling morphogenetic processes through local interactions and selforganization.
    We apply NCAs to a number of prototypical complex systems ranging from morphogenesis
    to reaction-diffusion systems. We explore the capacity of NCA to not only replicate
    complex visual patterns, but also to learn the underlying update rules of dynamic
    systems from spatiotemporal image sequences. We reproduce the behaviour of a morphogenesis
    system through various training regimes and demonstrate how training strategies
    critically inﬂuence the ability of the NCA to grow, persist, and regenerate patterns
    from visual data. We ﬁnd that NCAs cannot be applied “out of the box" to these
    diverse problems but must be adapted. We introduce a stratiﬁed multi-step training
    process that can be used to train NCAs to replicate diverse complex systems from
    image observations. Our approach demonstrates the potential for learning complex
    system dynamics from purely visual observations, a key capability for imageomics
    applications. Lastly we ﬁnd that NCAs use the hidden channels to generalize to
    novel behaviour. We further analyse the role of hidden channels in encoding spatial
    memory and guiding complex pattern formation. Our experiments provide new insights
    into how neural CA can be adapted as general-purpose models for learning, replicating,
    and possibly innovating system dynamics from image-based observations. Our ﬁndings
    illustrate the versatility of NCA as a self-organising and rule-learning system
    (albeit with complex training regimes) and suggest broader applications in modelling
    natural and artiﬁcial systems through visual pattern analysis.
